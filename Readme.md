DApp that consists of:
1. A smart contract in Solidity that saves and reads a message.
Hints:
    * Solidity is the most used language to write smart contracts on Ethereum. We like to see your search and learning capabilities.

2. Use TypeScript to Provide a webpage that reads and writes the message.
Hints:
    * You may use `web3.js`, `ethers.js`, `viem`, `hardhat` or what ever you find convenient.
    * You my use React, Angular, Vue, or without any of them.
    * If you are not familiar with Typescript you can try with JavaScript and then convert the code.
    * It is better to push the code changes that you develop once for every feature or once a day (using git to GitHub or GitLab or similar).

Bonus (additional nice to have):
* It would be nice if you used TypeScript Generics at some part of your code somewhere.
* Host this page on GitHub pages.
* Publish an npm package that does the basic functionality.
* Contains a unit test (using `jest` of a similar test framework for TypeScript).
* Run the unit test in GitHub actions on every code push or MR.


I have ,ade a Simple Express Application that provides the requested functionality.
